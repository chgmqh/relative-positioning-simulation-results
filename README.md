# relative-positioning-simulation-results
relative positioning simulation results for paper:A cluster positioning architecture and relative positioning algorithm based on pigeon flock bionics

Each folder represents a simulation scene，the number of each picture represents the simulation moment.
The three simulation results at each moment are:true position， positioning result， objective function curve.
